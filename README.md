# Time to Work

A web application designed to help users manage their workday with timers and a task list. The application features a Workday Timer, a Focus Timer, and a task management system where tasks can be added, edited, completed, and reordered. The app also includes a settings menu for customizing default timer values.

## Features

- **Workday Timer**: A countdown timer that defaults to 8 hours but can be customized.
- **Focus Timer**: A Pomodoro-style timer with a 52-minute work session followed by a 17-minute break.
- **Task List**: Add, edit, reorder, and mark tasks as complete. Completed tasks are automatically moved to the bottom of the list.
- **Settings Menu**: Customize the default times for the Workday and Focus Timers through a settings interface.
